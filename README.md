This was my second attempt creating portfolio with html and css only. Understanding how really css grid works and how to apply it in the code. 
If you any pointers about my code and how i can improve please tell , i am eager to learn!
I know that i dont use comments enough or at all , i am aware of that and i will try to improve in that!
Dont mind the lorem lines , this is not the official portfolio.
