                <h2>About me</h2>
                My name is Bagrat Tchintchaladze and have been coding for 3-6months now. HTML,CSS and Javascript is way to go for me, also frameworks like reactjs is something that 
                i try to master, slowly but steady. <br>
                Why web dev u might ask?! Well for a simple reason, i love it. Doing front-end is something that i really enjoy! <br>
                Having passion for something is important thats the main reason for me keep on going forward. <br>
                I want to keep this real short , if u have any more questions about me, u can contact me
